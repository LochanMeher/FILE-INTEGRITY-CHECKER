## Description:
This project involves developing a **File Integrity Checker** using Python to enhance cybersecurity measures. The tool monitors changes in files by calculating and comparing their SHA-256 hash values. It helps detect unauthorized modifications, deletions, or tampering of files within a specified directory. By generating a secure baseline and verifying it against real-time file states, this script ensures data authenticity and integrity, making it ideal for protecting sensitive or critical system files. The solution leverages Python libraries like `hashlib` and `json`, and serves as a foundational utility for digital forensics and system monitoring tasks.
